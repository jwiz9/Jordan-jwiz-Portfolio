## Description


The purpose of this project is to provide a snapshot for future employers to see what I can accomplish with coding at the momment. I built this project to show employers I have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and Advanced CSS. This project works as a supporting web page for my resume once I'm finished the coding boot camp that I can keep adding to, to show my advancement in the practice of coding. This project helped me review everything I have learned so far and look into techniques to improve my ability to put together a web page from scratch.
