            I am a aspiring web developer looking to showcase my skills and talent on projects I find 
            interesting. I'm currently enrolled in the SCS Coding Boot Camp offered by the University 
            of Toronto. This program will conclude November 29, 2022; then, I will be trained in a 
            plethora of programming languages and be ready to take on many different kinds of projects.
            Previously, I graduated from University of Toronto with a Honours Bachelor of Arts, where I 
            was given the opporunity to explore social issues and write or present certain topics using
            critical analysis. While my program had nothing to do with coding, I have always been attatched 
            to my computer. My nickname, jwiz, represents my online identity I use across multiple platforms 
            available on the computer.
