            I am a aspiring web developer looking to showcase my skills and talent on projects I find 
            interesting. I'm currently enrolled in the SCS Coding Boot Camp offered by the University 
            of Toronto. This program will conclude November 29, 2022; then, I will be trained in a 
            plethora of programming languages and be ready to take on many different kinds of projects.
            Previously, I graduated from University of Toronto with a Honours Bachelor of Arts, where I 
            was given the opporunity to explore social issues and write or present certain topics using
            critical analysis. While my program had nothing to do with coding, I have always been attatched 
            to my computer. My nickname, jwiz, represents my online personal I use across multiple platforms 
            available on the computer from game modding to social media. I enjoy using the computer as a 
            tool to solve issues that interest me whether that be paper editing, graphic designing, and content 
            creation. The computer also serves a huge part in my daily consumption of news and generates 
            most of my hobbies like gaming, streaming, blogging, and much more.
          </p>

            Currently, I'm a fresh graduate with experience in more manual labour and marketing type roles 
            like operating machinery and product management. I'm looking for opportunities to mold my working 
            experience away from manual labour and marketing, but I will continue to carry these skills into 
            whatever my future holds.
          </p>

            My ultimate goal in coding is to never stop improving, and never give up. I have no doubt in my 
            ability to become a well-rounded coder since I know I will never get tired of navigating any space 
            my computer will allow me to get to, and I will exhaust every resource I have to complete what is 
            assigned to me. Thank you for reading about me.
